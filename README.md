# etch-a-sketch

## Project Description

Create an etch a sketch using flex in CSS and javascript. Also try two challenges: have a random color chooser and have a button that increases opacity of color by 0.1 for shading.

## Overview 

This was a bit challenging to make but overall still fun. I made sure to take my time and fix all the bugs before pushing it to Github so that I'm proud of the final product. As you can see, I've put most of those bugs and challenges into the README section below. I'm really happy about how it turned out and surprised by my progress in Javascript as I really expected to struggle with this more than I did.

## Bugs/Challenges

- below 9, the divs overflow the game section -- SOLVED
    - to try: put border into javascript instead of css and have border size as variable 
    - above 48 it still doesn't work

- make sure you cant select 0 or above 70 (it gets laggy at that) -- SOLVED

- need to get button to change color -- SOLVED

- add opacity feature - DONE

- weird lines appear between certain rows; doesn't seem to affect much though - SOLVED
    - i removed the height of the game area in CSS so that it can choose its own
